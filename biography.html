							<p>Joseph Calabrese was born in Brooklyn, New York. He received his BFA from Hunter College, Manhattan, New York. For a brief time – as a graduate student majoring in sculpture - he attended Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York. Joseph, soon after, won several first place awards and on-site public commissions including: Bergen Community College, Paramus, New Jersey and Borough Hall Park, Brooklyn, New York.</p>
							<p>“Although my early work was original in its basic concept and commercially acceptable, I felt it was too heavily influenced by those professional artists’ work I admired as a student. My work had not yet found its own niche, its own creative vocabulary – one in which only I would have a voice.”</p>
							<p>In 1978 Joseph left his downtown Manhattan – NYC loft-studio and relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico. This move was of particular significance to the evolution of his aesthetic as an artist. There his natural instincts as an artist were profoundly inspired and deeply enriched by Native American and Spanish-Mexican cultures. Later he relocated to San Francisco, California where he presently resides and works as an artist. Since then – not surprisingly – Joseph’s artwork has found its own niche. This is now well exemplified in his one of a kind realistic clay renderings of life size wild life. He is inspired by his love of Nature and his boundless passion for the vast diversity of Humankind. Its multitude of cultures.  The survival of their ancestral past, their ritualistic behavior and finery woven into their everyday lives.</p>
							<p>&quot;Where there is love and passion, there is power and magic.&quot;</p>

						<p>For many years – as a mixed media artist – I worked in a variety of materials including: found objects, manufactured steel, wind, water, paper mache’ and finally clay -  to name a few.  Not surprisingly I’ve acquired an esthetic appreciation for more than just a handful of materials. For several years – while living in Santa Fe, NM. - I enjoyed working in paper mache’.  I found the scope of possibilities inherent in its properties impressive – along with the infinite number of textures and applications it will lend itself to. These were early works I refer to as Assemblages – heavily influenced by Native American culture.</p>
						<p>Sometime in early 2013 my work changed direction. I became interested in Realism. Namely – the realistic rendering of – though not limited to – life size wild life. I found clay best suited for my new work. It allows for finer detailing and texturing required when seeking life like results. I’m still working with paper mache’ – however, more as a structural means – adding strength to the clay. These materials used in various ways are best suited for what it is I’m trying to accomplish with my artwork.</p>
						<p>It’s an endless fascination and joyous feeling – to bring something into our world – that would otherwise not exist.</p>
